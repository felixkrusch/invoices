# Self-Hosted, Per-Customer Update Delivery

**Status:** Core delivery pipeline implemented (signed images, cosign keyless, GHCR, updater sidecar, manifest, health-gated rollback). Commercial model and trial-to-licensed transition are now specified in [Licensing-and-Trial.md](./Licensing-and-Trial.md). The separate entitlement service for license key issuance and verification is still to be built.
**Context:** entrytwo is a **proprietary, closed-source**, self-hosted, double-entry
accounting app. The commercial model is **perpetual license + annual maintenance/
support subscription** (see §9). Deployment is *one instance per customer* (or per
organization), where the customer owns their server and their financial data. This
document plans how we deliver secure updates to those instances without reinventing
software-update cryptography.

---

## 1. Goal & non-negotiables

- **One instance per customer.** We never hold customer ledgers centrally.
- **Source not publicly distributed; commercial license governs use.** We do *not*
  publish the source on a public repo anyone can clone, and use is governed by a
  commercial license — but we make **no claim to hide the source from the operator**.
  On a self-hosted box the server admin can always inspect the running image, so
  obscurity is not a control. The license is a *legal* instrument, not technical
  DRM. (They still *own their data* and their server — that is the promise.)
- **"You own your data" is a real property, not just marketing.** Updates must
  never exfiltrate, centralize, or require us to touch customer data.
- **Perpetual license + annual maintenance.** The customer buys the software
  outright; updates + support are delivered while maintenance is active (see §9).
  A lapsed instance is *never disabled* — it simply stops receiving new versions.
- **Updates must be authentic and tamper-evident.** A customer instance must
  only ever run code we actually shipped.
- **Safe by default.** Failed updates roll back automatically; backups precede
  migrations; the app process cannot rewrite its own code.
- **No custom crypto, no custom transport security.** We stand on maintained,
  audited, industry-standard tooling.

## 2. Threat model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Attacker pushes a malicious image to our registry | Signature verification rejects it at pull time |
| Compromised `main` branch / CI | Signing identity is tied to a specific trusted workflow + tag |
| Replay of an old, vulnerable version (rollback attack) | Digest-pinned pulls + version floor in the signed manifest |
| Freeze attack (hide that an update exists) | Signed manifest with expiry/timestamp; customer checks on open |
| Lapsed maintenance → forced downtime | Not possible: instance is never disabled; it only stops receiving new versions |
| Mix-and-match (good + bad parts) | Whole-image digest signature, not per-file |
| Compromised running app (e.g. via chat/LLM) self-modifies | App has no permission to replace the running image; only the isolated updater does |
| Stolen signing key | Keyless signing → no long-lived key to steal; identity-based trust + rotation |

---

## 3. Do we reinvent the wheel? — No.

The user asked directly: *do Docker and GitHub have reliable options so we don't
reinvent the wheel?* **Yes.** Both provide mature, maintained building blocks in
2026, and we use them rather than writing our own update framework.

**What GitHub gives us (delivery + signing identity):**
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** — hosts our signed images *and* their
  signatures (cosign stores signatures as co-located OCI artifacts). No separate
  signature server needed.
- **GitHub Actions** — builds the image and signs it with **cosign keyless
  signing**: the runner proves its identity via an OIDC token, Fulcio issues a
  short-lived cert, the signature is recorded in the Rekor transparency log.
  **No signing key to store, rotate, or leak.** The signature is bound to our
  exact workflow (e.g. `…/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/v*`), so verification
  checks *who* signed, not just *that a key signed*.
- **GitHub Releases** — hosts the human-readable changelog/manifest per version.

**What Docker gives us (the unit of deployment + verification):**
- **OCI images** are the immutable, reproducible deployment unit.
- **cosign** verifies a pulled image's signature against our pinned identity
  before it is ever run. TUF (The Update Framework) is already embedded in
  cosign's trust root, so rollback/freeze/replay resistance comes for free.
- **Watchtower** (maintained forks) can auto-pull + recreate containers **with
  signature verification enabled** (`WATCHTOWER_VERIFY_SIGNS`), as can several
  maintained alternatives (Dockhand, Docker-Sentinel, Drydock, docker-updater).

**Decision:** Build + sign in GitHub Actions → push to GHCR → customer-side
updater **verifies the cosign signature** and pulls the image **by digest** →
recreates the container → runs DB migration. We do not `git pull` source, do not
build on the customer machine, and do not trust a moving branch.

## 4. Architecture overview

```
[ Us / CI ]                              [ Customer instance ]
─────────────                           ─────────────────────
GitHub Actions                          1. Updater sidecar (isolated)
  ├─ build image  ──┐                   2. Check signed manifest (on open / webhook)
  ├─ cosign sign ──┼──▶ GHCR ◀── pull ─┘3. Verify cosign signature (keyless identity)
  │   (keyless)    │   (signed img)     4. Full DB backup
  └─ SBOM + SLSA   │                    5. `compose pull` image @sha256:...
      attestation  │                    6. `prisma migrate deploy` (one-shot job)
                   └─▶ GitHub Release   7. Recreate app container (same volumes/env)
                       (manifest +       8. Health gate → on fail: rollback to
                        changelog)           previous digest + pre-update backup
```

The **app** only *shows* "Update available vX.Y.Z" and exposes an *Apply* action.
The **updater** (a separate, least-privilege component) *applies* it. This
separation is the core security property: a compromised app cannot mutate itself.

---

## 5. Release pipeline (CI) — what we ship

A single GitHub Actions `release` workflow, triggered on version tags (`v*`):

1. Checkout, set up Buildx, build & **push by digest** to GHCR
   (`ghcr.io/<org>/entrytwo:1.4.2` + `@sha256:…`).
2. **Sign** with cosign keyless (`cosign sign --yes ghcr.io/...@<digest>`).
   Sign the *multi-arch index*, not per-arch manifests.
3. **Attest** SBOM (Syft/CycloneDX) + **SLSA provenance** (`actions/attest-build-provenance`).
4. Publish a **signed release manifest** (a small JSON: version, image digest,
   minSupportedVersion, changelog ref, published-at, signature) to GitHub Releases.
5. Optionally fire a **webhook** to notify instances a new version is available
   (see §7).

Guardrails:
- Sign *by digest*, never by mutable tag.
- `id-token: write` + `packages: write` permissions only on the release job.
- Keep the signing workflow path strict and reviewed; verification policy pins
  the exact workflow identity.

---

## 6. Customer-side updater (sidecar)

A small, isolated service (its own container, narrow Docker socket access) with
our **public verification key / trusted Sigstore root pinned at provisioning**:

- **Check:** fetch the signed manifest (cheap; on admin-open or via webhook —
  *not* a 60s poll). Compare to the running digest/version.
- **Verify:** `cosign verify` the target image digest against our signing
  identity (`--certificate-identity-regexp`, `--certificate-oidc-issuer
  https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`). Refuse to proceed on mismatch.
- **Backup:** full DB export of *all* tables (the current code only backs up a
  subset — fix this) to durable storage with integrity check.
- **Apply:** `docker compose pull <app>@sha256:…` then `up -d`; run migration as
  a one-shot job (`prisma migrate deploy`) before the app serves traffic.
- **Health gate + rollback:** after recreate, run a health check; on failure,
  recreate the *previous* pinned digest and restore the pre-update backup.

Why a dedicated sidecar instead of plain Watchtower: we get audit logging,
entitlement gating, the in-app UX we already built, and a single trust boundary
we control. Watchtower (with `WATCHTOWER_VERIFY_SIGNS`) remains a valid *fallback*
for users who prefer it.

---

## 7. In-app UX (no 60s polling)

- The Update page fetches the signed manifest **when an admin opens it**, and we
  optionally push a webhook on release so the banner appears promptly.
- No background 60s interval. A daily background check (or webhook) is plenty.
- "Update available vX.Y.Z" shows changelog; *Apply* calls the updater and shows
  real progress (backup → verify → migrate → restart), not a blind 3s reload.
- Honest "up to date" + last-checked timestamp.

---

## 8. Security: new model vs. current `git pull`

| Property | Today (`git pull origin/main`) | Proposed (signed image) |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of deployment | source on a branch | immutable signed OCI image (by digest) |
| Build location | customer machine | our CI |
| Auth on update endpoint | **none** (public route) | isolated updater, admin-gated apply |
| Integrity | none (whatever is on `main`) | cosign signature bound to our CI identity |
| Rollback/freeze resistance | none | TUF-rooted digest pinning + manifest |
| App can self-modify | effectively yes | no — only the updater can |
| Backup before update | partial (subset of tables) | full, integrity-checked |
| Rollback on failure | none | automatic to previous digest + backup |
| Supply-chain attestation | none | SBOM + SLSA provenance |

---

## 9. Commercial model — perpetual license + annual maintenance

**Decided.** entrytwo is sold as a **perpetual license** (customer owns the right
to run the software) plus an **annual maintenance & support subscription** that
entitles the customer to updates and support for that year.

- **Customer buys the software outright** → "you own it" is literally true (their
  running instance + their data). We don't publish the source publicly, but on
  self-hosted the operator can always inspect it — so we make no obfuscation
  claims. The commercial license is a *legal* grant, not a technical lock, and a
  purchased version never stops working.
- **Maintenance active → updates + support delivered.** Maintenance lapsed → the
  instance **keeps running on its current version** and simply stops receiving
  new ones. It is *never* remotely disabled. Renewal (with optional reinstatement)
  resumes delivery.
- **Recurring revenue without hostage dynamics.** This is the Red Hat / enterprise
  infrastructure model: predictable yearly maintenance revenue *and* an ownership
  trust story — the only model where both are true at once, and the right fit for
  "you own your data."

### Licensing posture

Source is **not publicly distributed** (no public repo anyone can clone) and use is
governed by a **commercial license** — but we make **no technical obfuscation
claims**. On a self-hosted box the server admin can always inspect the running
image, so hiding the source is neither possible nor a control we rely on. The license
is a **legal grant, not technical DRM**: it defines permitted use and binds
support/maintenance, and it is enforced commercially (terms, invoices), not by code.
This is exactly why entitlement gates *delivery of updates* and *support* — never the
running app or the customer's data — and why we never attempt to remotely disable a
purchased instance.

### Entitlement-aware delivery (how the model is enforced)

Enforcement lives at the **delivery layer only**, never at the running app.

**Important:** The self-hosted app follows a "verify once, trust forever" policy
(see [Licensing-and-Trial.md](./Licensing-and-Trial.md)):
- The external verify service is called **only once**, at the moment a customer
  pastes a license key (activation).
- After successful activation, the key is stored locally and the instance is
  permanently licensed. No further calls to the verify service are made for
  status, UI, or update checks.
- Update gating in the app only checks the stored licensed flag (never re-verifies).

The update delivery layer still respects entitlement:

1. On update check, the instance presents its **license token** to our
   entitlement service (future / optional).
2. We return the latest digest the token is entitled to (tier + maintenance
   status). Lapsed maintenance → manifest returns the customer's current/supported
   version, so they don't see newer ones.
3. **Security carve-out (non-negotiable):** critical CVE fixes for the supported
   major line are *always* published, regardless of maintenance status. Gating
   security fixes behind payment is both unethical and reputationally toxic for
   financial software.
4. Channels: `stable` for active maintainers; `beta`/early-access for higher tiers.

### Other commercial notes

- **One signed image, not per-customer builds.** Entitlement is a manifest-layer
  concern; we never ship bespoke images (ops nightmare, weakens signing story).
- **Feature gating stays in-app**, not in the update layer — maintenance entitles
  *updates*, while optional add-ons/tiers can gate *features* separately if needed.
- **Marketing alignment:** "self-hosted, you own your data" is technically true —
  we cannot read ledgers, updates are verifiable/refusable by the customer, and a
  purchased version never stops working. Strong, defensible claim.
- **Registry:** GHCR to start; for larger customers we can mirror signed images to
  their own registry — verification still uses *our* signing identity, so mirroring
  does not weaken trust.
- **Break-glass:** documented, time-limited bypass if signature infra is down, with
  mandatory audit log + auto-expire.

## 10. Migration from the current implementation

1. Replace `app/api/admin/update/route.ts` git-pull logic with an **authenticated**
   "apply" call to the updater sidecar (remove `/api/admin/update` from
   `middleware.ts` `publicRoutes`; require ADMIN session).
2. Replace the partial backup with the **full** backup (reuse
   `/api/backup/export`).
3. Replace `git fetch/pull` + `npm install` + `npm run build` with
   `compose pull @digest` + `migrate deploy` + recreate.
 4. Add signature verification before any pull. ✅ Implemented —
    `app/api/admin/update/route.ts` verifies the target digest against a keyless
    cosign identity (`COSIGN_IDENTITY`) or a pinned public key (`COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY`);
    on by default, required unless `UPDATE_VERIFY_SIGNATURE=false`.
 5. Add a `Dockerfile` that actually runs the app (the current one is a `fortune`
    placeholder) and ship a working `compose.yaml` for customers. ✅ Done
    (`Dockerfile`, `docker-entrypoint.sh`, `compose.yaml` mount the host Docker
    socket so the instance can self-update).
 6. Add the GitHub Actions release workflow (build → cosign keyless sign → GHCR →
    SBOM/SLSA → manifest). ✅ Done (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): multi-arch
    build pushed by digest, keyless cosign sign, SBOM + SLSA attestation, and a
    signed `manifest.json` published as a release asset.
 7. Update the in-app check to use the signed manifest on open / webhook. ✅ Done —
    the Update page fetches the manifest on open (no 60s poll) and the apply flow
    pulls the image **by digest** from that manifest with staged progress.

---

## 11. Suggested rollout

- **Phase 0 — Stop the bleeding:** lock down the current update endpoint
  (auth + full backup). *(Independent of the rearchitecture.)*
- **Phase 1 — Real images:** working `Dockerfile` + `compose.yaml`; manual
  `docker compose pull && up -d` updates by the customer.
- **Phase 2 — Signed + verified:** CI signs images; customer `compose`/updater
  verifies before applying.
- **Phase 3 — In-app UX + channels:** manifest check on open/webhook, beta
  channel, health-gated rollback.

---

## 12. Open decisions (remaining, before implementation)

**Decided:** commercial model = pay-to-own perpetual license after a 30-day trial, followed by optional annual maintenance for updates and support. See [Licensing-and-Trial.md](./Licensing-and-Trial.md) for the full trial + licensing + entitlement rules. The post-licensing behavior (never disable the running app, maintenance only gates new versions) remains as described in this document (§9).

Still open (technical):
- **Updater vehicle:** ✅ Implemented as a **dedicated sidecar** (`updater/`,
  `compose.yaml` `updater` service). The app no longer mounts the Docker socket;
  it authenticates to the sidecar over HTTP with `UPDATER_TOKEN` and the sidecar
  performs pull / migrate / recreate / health-gate / rollback. An in-app fallback
  (app holds the socket) remains in `route.ts` when `UPDATER_URL` is empty, for
  non-compose or dev deployments. Watchtower-with-`WATCHTOWER_VERIFY_SIGNS` is
  still a valid alternative for users who prefer it. Future hardening: front the
  socket with a scoped proxy (e.g. `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`) granting only
  the API verbs `compose`/`containers`/`images` need.
- **Entitlement service:** standalone license service vs. lightweight token check;
  where license tokens are issued/stored; reinstatement rules for lapsed maintenance.
  **Not implemented** — updates are currently delivered to any instance that can
  read the (public) release manifest. Gate delivery here when the commercial
  enforcement layer lands (see §9).
- **License token format & validation:** how the instance proves entitlement on
  each update check (opaque signed token vs. JWT; offline-tolerant validation).

Resolved by the current implementation (defaults, overridable):
- **Manifest transport:** GitHub Releases — `UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` points at the raw
  `manifest.json` asset.
- **Keyless vs. pinned-key verification:** both supported. Keyless identity
  (`COSIGN_IDENTITY` + `COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER`) is the default; a pinned public key
  (`COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY`) takes precedence for offline/air-gapped customers. The
  manifest blob itself is also cosign-signed (`manifest.json.sig`) for an
  offline-tolerant manifest check.
- **Registry:** GHCR for all (per-tier mirrors via re-signing later if needed).
- **Check cadence:** on-open (manual refresh) — no background 60s poll. Webhook
  push (§7) is a future nicety, not required.
