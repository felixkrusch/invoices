# invoices - Setup & Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through getting a local development instance of invoices running from scratch, including the database, seeding, and creating your first admin user.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (local or via Docker)
- Git

Optional but recommended:
- Docker & Docker Compose (for the included compose files)

---

## 2. Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/felixkrusch/invoices.git
cd invoices

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your DATABASE_URL

# 4. Start PostgreSQL (choose one)

# Option A: Docker Compose (easiest)
docker compose up -d

# Option B: Local Postgres
# Make sure you have a database called "invoices" and update DATABASE_URL accordingly.

# 5. Run migrations and seed
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed   # or: npx prisma db seed

# 6. Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

On first visit you should be able to create the initial **ADMIN** user if none exists (see "First Admin Bootstrap" below).

---

## 3. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

```env
# Required

## 4. Obtaining OAuth Credentials

### Google OAuth

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
4. Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**
5. Choose **Web application** type
6. Set **Authorized redirect URI**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (local: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`)
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Microsoft Entra ID OAuth

1. Open [Azure Portal → Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps)
2. **New registration** → name it invoices
3. Supported account types: single tenant, or multitenant + personal Microsoft accounts (match your issuer)
4. Redirect URI (Web): `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id` (local: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id`)
5. Create a client secret under **Certificates & secrets**
6. Set in `.env`:
   - `MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID` = Application (client) ID
   - `MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET` = client secret value
   - `MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER` = `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0` or `.../common/v2.0`

### Magic links (SMTP)

Set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and ideally `SMTP_FROM` + `AUTH_URL`.  
In local development you can leave SMTP empty and use instant email sign-in (`/api/auth/dev`).

**Production / VPS:** see [VPS-Auth-Install.md](./VPS-Auth-Install.md). Production refuses to start without at least one real auth method (SMTP and/or Google and/or Microsoft), a public `AUTH_URL`, strong `AUTH_SECRET`, and `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`.

### Stripe (Payment Processor Feed)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Go to **Developers** → **Webhooks**
3. Click **Add endpoint**
4. Set endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created`
6. Copy the **Webhook secret** to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`
7. Set your **Secret key** (`sk_live_...` or `sk_test_...`) as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`

### PayPal (Payment Processor Feed)

1. Create a REST application in the PayPal Developer Dashboard.
2. Set `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_SECRET` in `.env`.
3. Create a webhook pointing to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/paypal`.
4. Set the resulting webhook ID as `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`.

Stripe and PayPal are the only supported live processor feeds. Other bank and card data is imported by uploading statements or transaction tables through chat.

---

## 5. Database

### Using Docker Compose (included)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts a Postgres container on port 5432 with the credentials from `compose.yaml`.

### Manual Postgres

Create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE invoices;
CREATE USER invoices WITH PASSWORD 'invoices_dev_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE invoices TO invoices;
```

Then set:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://invoices:invoices_dev_password@localhost:5432/invoices"
```

### Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Seeding

The seed creates:
- Standard chart of accounts
- Common tax rates (DE 19%/7%, AT 20%, US-CA 8.25%)
- A few sample contacts

```bash
npm run db:seed
# or
npx prisma db seed
```

---

## 6. First Admin Bootstrap (Important)

invoices is designed so that the very first user created in a fresh installation becomes an **ADMIN**.

Current behavior (development):
- If no `User` with role `ADMIN` exists, the system allows creating the first admin via a simple form (this will be surfaced in the Admin UI).
- Subsequent users can be created with roles `ADMIN`, `ACCOUNTANT`, or `VIEWER`.

In production this flow will be protected and usually triggered during initial onboarding.

---

## 7. Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Chat interface is on the left.
- Dynamic panels (accounts, journal, reports, P&L, audit) on the right.
- Upload PDF button is in the top bar.

---

## 8. Docker (Full Stack)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start the Next.js app + Postgres. Adjust ports in `compose.yaml` / `compose.debug.yaml` as needed.

---

## 9. Common Commands

```bash
# Database
npx prisma studio                 # Browse data
npx prisma migrate reset          # Danger: resets DB
npm run db:seed                   # Re-seed

# Code quality
npm run build
npm run lint
npm test                          # Requires a separate database ending in _test

# Production
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## 10. First Time Checklist

- [ ] Database is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- [ ] `npx prisma migrate dev` succeeded
- [ ] Seed completed (`npm run db:seed`)
- [ ] First ADMIN user created
- [ ] You can see the chart of accounts and create a manual journal entry
- [ ] You can upload a PDF and get a suggestion with currency + tax (if detected)
- [ ] Bank feed connections work (add `{"apiKey":"sk_test_..."}` for Stripe)
- [ ] OAuth and/or magic link tested when configured (optional in local dev — instant email is enough)
- [ ] Sign out works from the settings (gear) menu

---

## 11. Production Considerations

Full VPS auth checklist: **[VPS-Auth-Install.md](./VPS-Auth-Install.md)**.

- `NODE_ENV=production`; strong `AUTH_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars)
- `AUTH_URL` / `APP_PUBLIC_URL` = public **https** origin (no trailing slash)
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` behind nginx/caddy/traefik
- At least one real sign-in method: full SMTP and/or Google and/or Microsoft Entra ID
- Instant email (`/api/auth/dev`) is **disabled** in production
- New users after bootstrap need an invitation; OAuth/magic email must match the invite
- Admin TOTP is mandatory in production after first sign-in
- Use managed Postgres (or well-secured self-hosted); regular backups (Admin → Backup and/or `pg_dump`)
- Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for bank feed credential storage
- Set webhook secrets if using Stripe/PayPal feeds
- Confirm `GET /api/health` → `ready: true` and `auth.productionReady: true`

**Authentication status (2026-07-25):**
- ✅ Magic link (Auth.js + `VerificationToken`, branded SMTP, single-use)
- ✅ TOTP 2FA (mandatory admin setup + recovery codes)
- ✅ OAuth (Google, Microsoft Entra ID), invitation-gated
- ✅ Sign out in settings menu
- ✅ Production env validation on boot via `instrumentation.ts`

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

**"Error: P1001: Can't reach database server"**
- Check that Postgres is running and the host/port in `DATABASE_URL` are correct.
- For Docker, make sure you're connecting to the service name (`db`) from inside the container or use `localhost` from the host.

**Seed fails with unique constraint**
- Run `npx prisma migrate reset` (this will wipe data).

**Prisma client out of date after schema change**
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

---

## 13. Data Export/Import (Backup & Migration)

**Implemented:** Portable full-system backup and restore via Admin → Backup:
- A compressed `.etbackup` archive contains every database table and uploaded receipt/statement.
- SHA-256 checksums and row counts are validated before restore.
- Restore is a complete replacement intended for disaster recovery or migration to a fresh installation.
- The destination must use the original `ENCRYPTION_KEY` so encrypted bank credentials remain usable.

For complete database backup, use standard PostgreSQL tools:
```bash
# Export
pg_dump invoices > backup.sql

# Import  
psql invoices < backup.sql
```
